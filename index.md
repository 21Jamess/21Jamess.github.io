### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because I learned how to convert decimal
    feet into feet, inches, and eighths of an inch.
    I enjoyed writing code to handle the math and making sure the
    results were accurate. Running tests and seeing everything work was satisfying.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because I learned how to work with 2D vectors
    in C++ to organize and search population data for California counties.
    It was exciting to write functions that calculated populations and percentages,
    and I enjoyed testing and refining the code to ensure everything worked as expected.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because I built a Hi-Lo game that used a
    GameState class to manage guesses and compare user input to a secret number.
    It was rewarding to write clean, organized functions and see the game come to life,
    deepening my understanding of class design and control flow.
